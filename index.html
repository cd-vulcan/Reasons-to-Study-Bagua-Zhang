            <p>
                Ba Gua Zhang specializes in combating multiple opponents. We focus heavily on footwork, with the goal of being light and mobile while maintaining root, which provides a foundation for expressing power. With multiple opponents one does not wish to stay in one place, but to be constantly moving about, attacking at various angles while presenting as little of a target as possible. Naturally, these principles are effective against single opponents as well.
                No time should be wasted during attack or defense. This art is not a sport, and we do not train it as such. Many of the techniques we teach are quite brutal: the goal is to end the fight as quickly as possible. Expressions of violence should not be used for anything other than one’s own safety, or to ensure the safety of others.
                As an internal art, our power comes from proper body alignment, technique, and energy movement. Using the principles of Yin and Yang and of waving body, our system allows us to generate power efficiently and from short distances; and we can deliver a number of powerful strikes in a short amount of time. Coupled with our stepping system, we have an effective and complete method of self-defense.

            <p class="phase-text">
                Historically, the term Qi did not have a single definition, but for our purposes it means “life energy”. 
                Ba Gua Zhang Qi Gong focuses on improving one’s overall health through movements designed to stimulate increased circulation of Qi within the body. The movements focus on engaging the entire body, with particular attention paid to working the joints (strengthening the corresponding muscles, ligaments, and tendons), stimulating the body’s meridians and manipulating the fascia surrounding the organs. It improves the ability to acquire Qi from external sources (food and air) and to preserve the Qi and use it efficiently. By more effectively using and preserving our acquired Qi, we are less likely to dip into our Original Qi, which is the Qi given to us by our parents, and which is no longer developed after puberty. Preserving our Original Qi allows for better overall quality of life.
                Our system of Qi Gong, like the rest of our art, follows the concept of the Natural Trinity. The Qi Gong trinity is derived from this concept as well, and consists of:
                <ul class="qigong-list"> 
                    <li>Continuous Movement</li>
                    <li>Proper Breath</li>
                    <li>Purposeful Focus</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Wisdom:</h4> Without wisdom, a student will not be able to grasp the depth of Ba Gua Zhang and will not be able to develop his or her understanding to a high level. Wisdom is required to make progress; the student must “think deeply” and research thoroughly. <br>
                <h4>Benevolence:</h4> Without benevolence, a student’s pride, ego, or arrogance takes control. The Ba Gua Zhang practitioner must remain humble, show respect to everyone, and promote goodwill towards others. Ba Gua Zhang must never be utilized in an improper or unjust manner.  Benevolence is required and grows with the cultivation of wisdom. <br>
                <h4>Sincerity:</h4> A student must undertake their training with serious commitment in order to develop his or her skill to a high level. Lu Shui-Tian stated that “the instructor does not teach the student; the instructor merely presents knowledge and ideas – the students, in truth, teach and train themselves.” Hence sincerity, which grows with the cultivation of wisdom and benevolence, is a requirement of the practice. <br>
                <h4>Bravery:</h4> Without bravery, a student will lose his/her skill in a confrontation. A student needs to remain calm and clear whether facing an opponent in a sparring session or in a serious fight, and must learn to conquer and control his or her own fear.  To understand Ba Gua Zhang completely, the student must study and research the fighting side of Ba Gua, as well as the health side. Through the cultivation of wisdom, benevolence, and sincerity, a student’s bravery comes from the heart and is not derived out of ego or arrogance. The Ba Gua Zhang fighter must do what is just and what is required when a confrontation is necessary. And when a confrontation is necessary, the response must be immediate and without hesitation.
