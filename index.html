            <article style="text-indent:30px;">
                Ba Gua Zhang specializes in combating multiple opponents. We focus heavily on footwork, with the goal of
                being light and mobile while maintaining root, which provides a foundation for expressing power. With
                multiple opponents one does not wish to stay in one place, but to be constantly moving about, attacking
                at various angles while presenting as little of a target as possible. Naturally, these principles are
                effective against single opponents as well.
                No time should be wasted during attack or defense. This art is not a sport, and you do not train it as
                such. Many of the techniques taught are quite brutal: the goal is to end the fight as quickly as
                possible. Expressions of violence should not be used for anything other than one’s own safety, or to
                ensure the safety of others.
                As an internal art, our power comes from proper body alignment, technique, and energy movement. Using
                the principles of Yin and Yang and of waving body, our system allows us to generate power efficiently
                and from short distances; and we can deliver a number of powerful strikes in a short amount of time.
                Coupled with our stepping system, we have an effective and complete method of self-defense. <br> <br>
                This system does not teach in an “if this then respond with this” manner. Our focus is on teaching
                principles. Originally Ba Gua was taught as a finishing art. Once a student proved proficient in a
                style, an instructor would apply Ba Gua principles to that which the student already knew, allowing for
                further growth and development. However, already knowing a martial art isn’t a requirement to learn this
                system. We can teach students with zero experience. Because it is a complete system, Ba Gua can be
                tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of each individual. No two people are alike. <br> <br>
                Becoming proficient as a fighter in Ba Gua Zhang is not a quick process. It takes some time for the
                student to develop what is called a “kung fu body.” The student must learn the fundamental postures,
                whipping body, stepping, breath, and focus. It takes time to develop one’s own Qi, and develop one’s
                body so the Qi can circulate freely. It takes time to learn to use this type of body for self-defense,
                moving in and around opponents quickly while striking powerfully and effectively without leaving oneself
                open to counter attacks. It’s no easy task. It takes time and perseverance. But the physical, emotional,
                mental, and spiritual rewards are significant.

            <article class="phase-text" style="text-indent:30px;">
                Historically, the term Qi did not have a single definition, but for our purposes it means “life energy”.
                Ba Gua Zhang Qi Gong focuses on improving one’s overall health through movements designed to stimulate
                increased circulation of Qi within the body. The movements focus on engaging the entire body, with
                particular attention paid to working the joints (strengthening the corresponding muscles, ligaments, and
                tendons), stimulating the body’s meridians and manipulating the fascia surrounding the organs. It
                improves the ability to acquire Qi from external sources (food and air) and to preserve the Qi and use
                it efficiently. By more effectively using and preserving our acquired Qi, we are less likely to dip into
                our Original Qi, which is the Qi given to us by our parents, and which is no longer developed after
                puberty. Preserving our Original Qi allows for better overall quality of life.
                Our system of Qi Gong, like the rest of our art, follows the concept of the Natural Trinity. The Qi Gong
                trinity is derived from this concept as well, and consists of:
                <ul class="qigong-list">
                    <li>Continuous Movement</li>
                    <li>Proper Breath</li>
                    <li>Purposeful Focus</li>

                <h4>Wisdom:</h4>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;">Without wisdom, a student will not be able to grasp the depth of Ba Gua
                    Zhang and will not be able to develop his or her understanding to a high level. Wisdom is required
                    to make progress; the student must “think deeply” and research thoroughly. </p>
                <h4>Benevolence:</h4>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;">Without benevolence, a student’s pride, ego, or arrogance takes control.
                    The Ba Gua Zhang practitioner must remain humble, show respect to everyone, and promote goodwill
                    towards others. Ba Gua Zhang must never be utilized in an improper or unjust manner. Benevolence is
                    required and grows with the cultivation of wisdom.</p>
                <h4>Sincerity:</h4>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;">A student must undertake their training with serious commitment in order to
                    develop his or her skill to a high level. Lu Shui-Tian stated that “the instructor does not teach
                    the student; the instructor merely presents knowledge and ideas – the students, in truth, teach and
                    train themselves.” Hence sincerity, which grows with the cultivation of wisdom and benevolence, is a
                    requirement of the practice. </p>
                <h4>Bravery:</h4>
                <p style="text-indent:30px;">Without bravery, a student will lose his/her skill in a confrontation. A
                    student needs to remain calm and clear whether facing an opponent in a sparring session or in a
                    serious fight, and must learn to conquer and control his or her own fear. To understand Ba Gua Zhang
                    completely, the student must study and research the fighting side of Ba Gua, as well as the health
                    side. Through the cultivation of wisdom, benevolence, and sincerity, a student’s bravery comes from
                    the heart and is not derived out of ego or arrogance. The Ba Gua Zhang fighter must do what is just
                    and what is required when a confrontation is necessary. And when a confrontation is necessary, the
                    response must be immediate and without hesitation.</p>
