This is my project to pass the Javascript Segment for Code Louisville. The topic is reguarding Bagua-zhang, a martial-art I have been studying for several years. Speaks on the reasons as to why one would learn the art, benefits and what makes the specific system diffrent then others. You will see there is a combination of flexbox and grid in use. Pertaining to the Javascript heavy portion, I choose to make a game that will allow you to adopt a pet and interact with it etc. The base animal object is "mastah Fu's pet". After having enter'd a name and email clicking 'submit' you'll recieve a dog. You will need to interact with this animal to raise his happiness level if you want to have the "happiest dog" when you press 'click me' underneath the "Click to find the dog with highest happiness." You can enter in as many emails and names as you want, the function willcheck aginst the base stats of Master FU's dog and display the winning owner of the latest highest happiness level.
  

Features:
 [JAVASCRIPT] [FILE: client.js]
- Email validation with Regex (requires atleast the @ etc will shoot out an error if not)
- Function inwhich takes 2 or more arguments and returns values
- Pulls external data from api utilizing aysnc await and returns promise (displaying new names, and dog photos)
- displaying info from an object / arrays (starting with base stats and then having a new animals stats generated that change as you interact with the object)

- Mobile First Responsive [FILE: styles.css]
- Hamburger Menu [mobile only], Custom animation (css)
- Media Queries at vairous sizes to fix viewing content atleast 2 (css)
- Wave animation featuring "nth-chid" selectors. (css)

- Form Validation username, and password (js) [bottom of page above footer] (withought the use of regex) [FILE: play.js]
    password is 123, if you dont use it you will get an alert.
    username requires input or alert will pop up.
    When you enter password correctly you see alert with input from username.
    Does not resuly in addiional access to the site.

- Use Event listeners and nodes for animation on top photo grid. Running the cursor and or clicking on .pngs "main word on top of Background img"
causes animation transition to black and reveals violet-purple quotes.

- We do have active links on the page:
Hamburger Menu 
Top Nav Bar 
Footer ("top of page" only above black footer)

- *SideNOTE* Was working on getting express.lib/node/npm up and running but ended up having to rearrange the skelton arrangement of the folders etc to get the project to wotk with github - pages as well as some other snags. So i have left the code commented out for now.


!Many Thanks for the oppurtunity to learn, this class has been rewarding in many ways. Many thanks to the mentors. Javascript is complex and am excited to have stumbled upon this journey.
